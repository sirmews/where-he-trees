# Incomplete
- songtick events incomplete. Ended up consuming quite my time doing this much.
# Done better

- Make use of the context api for some user specific theming
- Thought about my components better. I didn't plan much, just started on the task after looking at the Sketch design
- Obviously more testing, did the bare minimum to illustrate knowledge of and also because I hadn't created the song list
- Probably should have just used inline styles, would have sped up development
- Relatively new to typescript so probably not a good idea to have chosen that. Then again I'm making an effort to do all the things with it.
